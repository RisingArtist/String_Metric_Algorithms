# String_Metric_Algorithms
A programming exercise to help understand string distance algorithms

* Hamming Distance = Compares the two same length strings by their characters. 

* Levenshtein Distance = Creates a (M + 1) x (N + 1) matrix where it fills in cells with the number of operations ( Insertion / Deletion / Substitution ) it would take to have both strings to be the same.

where, 

M = the length of the first string

N = the length of the second string

* Damereau Distance = A modified version of Levenshtein but includes Transposition operation
